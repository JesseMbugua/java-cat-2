## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application relies on a PostgreSQL database with the following structure, as defined in `schema.sql`:

| Table     | Column      | Type             | Constraints                                  | Description                                  |
| :-------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `users`   | `id`        | `SERIAL`         | `PRIMARY KEY`                                | Unique identifier for each user.             |

        static final String USER = "postgres";
        static final String PASSWORD = "ShzT8gh6"; // Replace with your password
        ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * Compile the Java source files.
    * Run the `Main.java` class to start the application. The program starts with the registration screen.
